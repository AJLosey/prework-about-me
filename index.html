    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>behold my witty and creative introduction</p>
    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I spent all my life in Ohio until I moved to Austin last year</p>
    <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
    <p>Some reading, some writing, some videogames</p>
    <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
    <p>In an ideal world, counting insect populations in some remote wilderness. Perhaps more realistically, anything
      that allows me enough time and money to pursue indie game development on the side</p>
    <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
    <p>In an apartment in south Austin</p>
    <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
    <p>I was a custodian for a school, but due to financial and health concerns, really needed a change. My roommate is
      a developer, and offered to help me transition to a new line of work. He is the one that brought my attention to
      various coding bootcamp programs.</p>
